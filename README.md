# Basic schema
- Each process is a java process

- Each process has one thread to handle user Input, one thread to send message,
and one thread for receiving message from its peers.

- There is a master node to handle total order multicast.

- Each process maintain an internal vector clock

##Requirement
- MacOs or Linux

- Java 9 installed

- Gradle installed

## Project structure
TODO

## Build
```bash
gradle jar #(at root dir)
```

## Run
Run CausalMulticastDemo by .jar after build
```bash
java -cp build/libs/CS425MP1.jar Process.CausalMulticastDemo <id> configuration [script]
```

Run UnicastDemo by .jar after build
```bash
java -cp build/libs/CS425MP1.jar Process.UnicastDemo \<id\> configuration
```
```bash
./UnicastRun.sh 4 #(the number of process, has to be consistent to configuration file)
```
```bash
./CausalMulticastRun.sh 4 (the number of process, has to be consistent to configuration 
file) [script] #(read startup command from ./script directory)
```

## Available command

### Unicast
```
send <id> <message>
```

### Causal multicast

```
sleep (sleep for 1000ms)

clock (check current vector clock)

msend <message> [delay id=delay,id=delay...]
(the last delay will be used to other unspecified processes, current thread is always 0 (I think that make sense)
If not specified delay explicitly, random delay will be used)
```

### Exit
Just press Ctrl+C

## Script format

Same as available command (script is only available for causal multicast)
